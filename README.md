## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Development

### Requirement
 - git bash > 2
 - nodeJS > 16

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1.  `$ git clone https://github.com/raelvanz/Fazz-Bank-Integration.git`
2.  `$ npm install`
3.  `$ npm run dev` For development
4.  `$ npm run prodcution` For production

### Package And Third Party

1.  - Boostrap React Js (https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/)
2.  - Typescript for Next Js (https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript)

### Handling And Naming Rules For Each Branch

Basically using Git Workflow approach:

-   **main** Release stable source
-   **develop** Development source
-   **feature** no standardization for branch naming
-   **hotfix** tag ex: `1.1.1`, `1.1.2`, ... `1.1.x`
-   **release** tag ex: `1.1.1`, `1.2.0`, `2.0.0`, ... `x.x.0`
